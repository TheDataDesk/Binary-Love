# Binary Love: 1 or 1?
_A Valentine’s Day Website That Won’t Take "No" for an Answer_

## About This Project
This is not your average "Will you be my Valentine?" website. This is **Binary Love**, where your answer is **always YES**... whether you like it or not!  

- **The "No" button?** Oh, it’s there, but good luck clicking it—it shakes violently like it just saw its ex.  
- **Hover over "No"?** Evil face emojis start flying like a haunted love letter.  
- **Click "Yes"?** Confetti explodes, music plays, and true love is sealed forever.  

This website is basically **Cupid's cheat code**.

---

## How It Works
1. The user is asked: **"Will you be my Valentine?"**
2. **Clicking "Yes"**:
   - 🎊 Confetti explodes
   - 🎵 Background music starts
   - ✅ Love is confirmed
3. **Hovering over "No"**:
   - 🫨 It shakes like it’s scared
   - 😈 Evil face emojis pop up
   - ❌ You still can't click it
4. Eventually, you’ll accept your fate and hit **Yes**.

## How to Run Locally
```sh
git clone https://github.com/TheDataDesk/Binary-Love.git
cd Binary-Love
```

Open index.html in a browser.
Try escaping... (you can't).

## Why This Exists
Because saying "No" to love should be hard.
Because a moving "No" button is better than a ghosted text.
Because Valentine's Day is just an excuse to build weird websites.
